# random_number

This is a random guessing numbers game. The best games ever invented!

Notes:

1. This project is half complete!
2. The Graph illustration, ranking system is just a placeholder and meant to be finished.
3. The Guessing Number being generated was to be used for the multipier freezing points(not fully implemented).
4. both frontend and backend is being push into one repo.
5. backend does not require any .env variable.
6. frontend need to have a VITE_BASE_URL variable.

The current state of the project shows the completed frontend and backend design and talks to each other perfectly via socket. It created a poll of current users with their name, points, and multiplier.
It generate a random number and send it to front. The multiplications and few calculations are to be developed.
